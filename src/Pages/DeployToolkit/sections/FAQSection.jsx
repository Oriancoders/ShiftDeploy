      question: "How quickly can you start?",
      answer:
        "Most projects begin within 48 hours of our strategy call. For urgent issues, we can often start same-day. We keep capacity reserved for rapid response because we know technical problems don't wait for convenient timing.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with our existing team?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We're designed to augment your team, not replace them. We can work independently, collaborate closely, or train your team to maintain what we build. Whatever works best for your situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if you can't solve our problem?",
      answer:
        "We've never encountered a technical challenge we couldn't solve, but if we did, you wouldn't pay. Our 30-day money-back guarantee means you only pay for results, not attempts.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle security and access?",
      answer:
        "Security is our specialty. We use industry-standard security protocols, sign comprehensive NDAs, and can work within your existing security frameworks. Many of our clients are in highly regulated industries.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the project is complete?",
      answer:
        "We don't disappear. Every package includes ongoing support, and we're available for additional optimization, scaling support, or new challenges as they arise. Think of us as your technical insurance policy.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from hiring a development agency?",
      answer:
        "We're specialists, not generalists. While agencies build features, we solve problems. We focus on the technical challenges that keep CTOs awake at night â€” performance, scaling, security, and infrastructure.",
    },
    {
      question: "What size companies do you work with?",
      answer:
        "We work with startups from pre-seed to Series B and beyond. Our sweet spot is growing companies (10-200 employees) who need enterprise-level technical expertise without enterprise-level overhead.",
