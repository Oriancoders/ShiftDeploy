          <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-primaryBlue'>6) How Projects Are Engaged
          </h1>
          <p>
            Every project or engagement with ShiftDeploy begins with a shared
            understanding of scope, deliverables, and timelines. These details are
            typically defined in a written proposal, statement of work (SOW), or
            service agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            By confirming a project, you acknowledge and agree that:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 ">
            <li>All deliverables and deadlines are based on mutual agreement and communication.</li>
            <li>Client feedback and approvals are essential to maintaining timelines.</li>
            <li>Scope changes may require an updated estimate or revised delivery schedule.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We value transparent collaboration and always aim to document major
            decisions and project changes clearly.

          <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-primaryBlue'>7) Payments, Refunds & Billing
          </h1>
          <p>
            ShiftDeploy operates on a transparent billing structure. Payment terms and
            schedules are outlined in each client agreement or invoice.
          </p>
          <p>
            By confirming a project, you acknowledge and agree that:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 ">
            <li><strong>Invoices:</strong> Issued upon project initiation, milestone completion, or delivery — as defined in the engagement agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We accept bank transfers, online payments, or other approved channels.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> We refund full amount if client is not satisfied with milestone 1.  Generally not available after Milestons 1 is approved, except where legally required or explicitly stated.</li>
            <li><strong>Late Payments :</strong> May incur a reasonable service fee or delay in project progress.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For subscription-based or retainer services, clients will receive notice
            before any recurring billing renewal.
          </p>

        <section id='P_8' className='space-y-4 mb-10'>
          <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-primaryBlue'>8) Timelines, Revisions & Delivery
          </h1>
          <p>
            ShiftDeploy aims to meet all mutually agreed deadlines. Project timelines
            depend on both technical factors and client responsiveness.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 ">
            <li>All estimated delivery dates assume timely client feedback and content submission.</li>
            <li>Minor revisions are typically included within the defined scope.</li>
            <li>Significant changes requested after approval may result in revised estimates or schedules.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once final deliverables are handed over, clients are responsible for
            reviewing and confirming acceptance within the agreed review period.
          </p>

          <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-primaryBlue'>9) Ownership & Intellectual Rights
          </h1>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise stated in writing, all intellectual property created by
            ShiftDeploy during a client project — including but not limited to software
            code, designs, documentation, and technical strategies — remains the
            property of ShiftDeploy until full payment is received
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the project is fully paid for, ownership of the final deliverables
            explicitly defined in the agreement transfers to the client. However,
            ShiftDeploy retains rights to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Reuse or adapt general development frameworks and internal tools.</li>
            <li>Maintain ownership of pre-existing libraries or proprietary components used in delivery.</li>
            <li>Showcase non-confidential parts of the project in our portfolio or case studies, with client permission where applicable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
             Clients agree not to reproduce, redistribute, or sublicense any ShiftDeploy
    intellectual property beyond the terms of the agreement without written consent.
